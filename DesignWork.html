                    <p>The logo was created in 2014, with influence from young adult clothing, musical interest and how I overall dress day to day. Using the simple shapes of: circles, triangles, and squares, the overall structure was created. Thus, using the pen tool, anchor tool, line tool, a smidge of the paintbrush and the type tool, the animated Nikko was created.</p>

        <p> I painted this design in 2015, inspired by the human anatomy, the spring season, flowers blooming and my old sketches of hearts drawn years ago. Concentrating on dominant colors, I used heavy reds, purples, greens and etc, to draw the viewers' eyes around the heart. In order to make the organ more realistic, I used blacks and pinks to contrast with the red. Especially since there isn't anyone in the world with an ultimately healthy heart. Applying the pen tool, anchor tool, brush tool, magic wand tool, gradients, and erase tool, the Heart Flower piece was made. </p>

        <p> This poster was created in 2012, due to my friend needing a last minute advertisement for facebook, twitter, other social medias and to be printed. Since he is a DJ, we met up and discussed main points he wanted the poster to include, whether its summer, vibrant, fun and youthful sort of look. Placing found images, edgy-looking text and utilizing the pen and magic wand tool, the beach poster was published. </p>
