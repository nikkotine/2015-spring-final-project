               <p>I am Niccolo Brown, a student at University of Maryland Baltimore County. I am in my junior year of college, majoring and aiming for an Bachelors of Fine Arts in Graphic Design. I work at the financial aid office at Howard Community College and am hopeful/working on an internship for this summer of 2015. In my spare time, I love to continue my art passion with sketching, drawing, painting, photography and etc. Much of my inspiration comes from very vibrant colors and characteristics. 	Artists such as: Andy Warhol, Keith Haring and other pop artists influenced how I draw, and what I compile. Besides art, I am just like any other young adult who enjoys to go out, sight see, enjoy movies, and time with friends and family.  A mass amount of my family resides in South Carolina, thus I am in and out of the relaxing state 3-4 times a year. Although, deep down Maryland will always be my hometown. Anyways, I canâ€™t leave such exciting details to be read, get to know me and my art! Peace, Love and Happiness to all.</p>
